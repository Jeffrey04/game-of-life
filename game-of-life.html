        <div id="body">
            <h2>This is a story of how neighbours may determine one's lifelihood</h2>
            <p>A game board of arbitrary size is always available. Each cell in the
            game board has one of two available state, which is either live or die,
            on or off, 1 or 0.</p>

            <div id="intro"></div>

            <p>Each time you press the button "Evolve", there will be a round of
            evolution happening. Depending on the situation, there will be new cells
            coming alive, existing cells dying, or possibly, nothing changes.</p>

            <div id="evolution"></div>

            <p>Each time you press "Evolve", the cells on the board are evaluated to
            determine what the next phase is going to look like. You may wonder what
            the rules are, but basically it involves observing the count of neighbours.
            </p>

            <p class="emphasis"><strong>"Having the right amount of neighbours, you live, otherwise, you
            die."</strong></p>

            <p>There are just 4 rules to be followed, let's go through them 1 by one</p>

            <h3>Dying of loneliness</h3>

            <p>If a living cell has only 1 or none living cell neighbours, it dies. For
            example, the living cell in the middle has no neighbours, so it dies in
            the next evolution.</p>

            <div id="loneliness"></div>

            <p>As you can see, the neighbours of a given cell is the 8 surrounding
            cells (just like the little game where you clear mines).</p>

            <h3>Dying of suffocation</h3>

            <p>If a living cell is surrounded by more than 3 living cells, it dies.
            Notice how quite a number of cells died due to over-population after one
            evolution in the following example.<p>

            <div id="suffocation"></div>

            <h3>Optimum survival condition</h3>

            <p>So the optimal number of neighbours, is 2 or 3 living cells. Everyone
            has enough room to breathe, and not always surrounded by too many
            neighbours.</p>

            <div id="survive"></div>

            <h3>New mate to the game</h3>

            <p>So far we have only mentioned about the survivability of a living cell.
            There is actually a rule to simulate reproduction. If a dead cell is
            surrounded by 3 living neighbours, it comes alive.</p>

            <div id="reproduction"></div>

            <h3>Patterns</h3>

            <p>There are several patterns discovered when people start playing the game.
            For instance you have seen one in the example above, where there are no
            changes happening regardless how many times you hit the evolve button.
            It was an example of <strong>Still lifes</strong>.</p>

            <p>Here is another pattern discovered by others. You can see the pattern
            keeps repeating itself after a while. The following pattern is called
            a blinker, which is an example of <strong>oscillators</strong>.</p>

            <div id="blinker"></div>

            <p>And not forgetting <strong>spaceships</strong>, for example this glider
            below (press the Automate button to speed it up).</p>

            <div id="glider"></div>

            <h3>Game of Life</h3>

            <p>This game is known as the Game of Life. It was created by John Horton
            Conway and you may want to see
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Plq-D1gEk">this video</a> for
            more interesting facts about the game.</p>

            <p>Finally, you can have a play with the following sandbox. Hit the
            randomize to generate a board with random living cells.</p>
