            <p id="author">by <a href="http://coolsilon.com/">Jeffrey04</a></p>
        </div>

        <div id="body">
            <h2>This is a story of how neighbours may determine one's lifelihood</h2>
            <p>There exists this simple community, which can be represented by
            a grid of check boxes. Assuming each of them represents a person,
            and each of them can have anyone of the two states, which is either
            living or dead (or yet-to-be-borned).</p>

            <div id="intro"></div>

            <p>Each person's lifelihood, is determined by how many neighbours
            available. Neighbours are the people surrounding the person. Each
            evolution may bring in new members to the community, take some of them
            off, or nothing changes.</p>

            <div id="evolution"></div>

            <p>This community values neighbours, so the number of neighbours
            directly determines whether a person is able to survive an evolution.
            In short,
            </p>

            <p class="emphasis"><strong>"Having the right amount of neighbours, you
            live, otherwise, you die."</strong></p>

            <p>There are just 4 rules to be followed, let's go through them 1 by one
            </p>

            <h3>Dying of loneliness</h3>

            <p>We all know what it is like to be left alone, in this community
            loneliness is so bad that it may cause one to not survive an evolution.
            The person will be dead if there's only 1 or no one around him.</p>

            <div id="loneliness"></div>

            <p>Just in case you have not noticed, a person's neighbours are
            the other 8 surrounding cells.</p>

            <h3>Dying of suffocation</h3>

            <p>The opposite of loneliness is the feeling of suffocation. When
            there are too many people around, we lose the personal space we need.
            The same thing applies in this community, and if there are more than 3
            people surrounding a person, then the person dies.<p>

            <div id="suffocation"></div>

            <h3>Optimum survival condition</h3>

            <p>Therefore the optimum number of neighbours, is 2 to 3 people.
            Everyone has enough room to breathe, and not overwhelmed by too many
            neighbours around. I would say this is a win-win situation.</p>

            <div id="survive"></div>

            <h3>Let's breed, shall we?</h3>

            <p>A community keeps moving when there are changes to the structure,
            especially when there's an addition of new members. A new member is
            born, whenever there are exactly 3 living neighbours around.</p>

            <div id="reproduction"></div>

            <h3>Patterns</h3>

            <p>There are several patterns discovered when people start playing with
            the simulation. For instance you have seen one in the example above,
            where there were no changes happening regardless how many times you hit
            the evolve button.  It was an example of <strong>Still lifes</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>Here is another pattern discovered by others. You can see the pattern
            keeps repeating itself after a while. The following pattern is called
            a blinker, which is an example of <strong>oscillators</strong>.</p>

            <div id="blinker"></div>

            <p>And not forgetting <strong>spaceships</strong>, for example this
            glider below (press the Automate button to speed it up).</p>

            <div id="glider"></div>

            <h3>Game of Life</h3>

            <p>This game is known as the Game of Life. It was created by John Horton
            Conway and you may want to see
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Plq-D1gEk">this video</a> for
            more interesting facts about the game.</p>

            <p>Finally, you can have a play with the following sandbox. Hit the
            randomize to generate a board with random living cells.</p>
